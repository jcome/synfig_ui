#Questions
- What is physical width/height?  

- What is image span?  

- What is image area?  
it seems like origin point of coordinate of canvas
- What is Locks and Links?  

- What is Focus Points?  

- Canvas Options is not yet ready for final users, shall we remove them till they are implemented completely and properly?  
When saying completely and properly, I mean we need to design (UI and UX) and then code them down, test, publish to end users.

#Canvas Properties Editor Proposal
- Canvas Info
	- Name
	- Description (should be in multi-line instead of single line) 
- Canvas Size 
	- Width / Height (there is a preset avaible)
	- Resoultions X / Y (X and Y are linked by default)
	- Origin Point （positon of the canvas point to (0,0)）
- Time
	- FPS, Start and End time, Duration 
- Advanced Settings ()
	- Locks and Links
	- Focus Point X/Y
	- And other things in most cases user don’t want to change from time to time. I am not sure if metadata is recorded in sif document, if yes, we can attach those parameters in here too, so that we migrate Canvas Options to Canvas Properties Editor.
